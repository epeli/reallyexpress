# Really Express

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/epeli/reallyexpress.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Really Express is a small wrapper for [Express][] web framework. It focuses on
bringing extraordinary features of [Node.js][] to Express. That is mainly
**code sharing between the server and the browser** and **integrating
WebSockets as first class citizens**. Really Express is somewhat inspired by
[Zappa][] web framework.
